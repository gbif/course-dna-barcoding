"This course will teach you how to use DNA barcodes, collection and "
"observation data to resolve research questions in biodiversity.  The "
"programme uses a combination of lectures, tutorials, and hands-on "
"exercises.  You will learn to handle biodiversity data including DNA "
"barcoding.  You will gain practical experience in using open and digitally "
"documented biodiversity data through GBIF and BOLD to answer biodiversity "
"research questions.  You will understand and practice capturing observation, "
"collection, and genetic data from analogue and digital sources.  Finally, "
"this course provides basic skills in data publishing through GBIF and BOLD."
